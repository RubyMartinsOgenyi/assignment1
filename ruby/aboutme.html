    <h1>Fun things about me</h1>
    <blockquote class="comment">
        My name is Ruby Martins-Ogenyi . I come from a family of four. At a young age, I got a flair for the digital world, computers, phones and the likes. And at the age of 16 I had successfully gotten a certificate for an operating systems program in Sheridan college Ontario, Canada and got an internship in a Digital marketing and web design company. My love for photography started when I realized there was a lot that went beyond just the photograph in photography, I went ahead to research on how to use apps and eventually took photography courses both online and in school added with the fact that I had taken loads of computer courses.
